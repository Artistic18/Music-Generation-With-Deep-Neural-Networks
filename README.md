# Music-Generation-With-Deep-Neural-Networks
This is a simple project of generating midi music files using a neural network.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Music21
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* h5py

## Steps To Reproduce

To train the network run:
```
python music.py
```
Note: You can add your own midi files in the midi_songs directory.

Once the training is complete, You can generate the new midi file using
```
python generate.py
```
